    <h2>How to Conduct an Informal Code Inspection</h2>

    <ol>
      
      <li><p><strong>Team Makeup</strong></p>
        
        <p> Code inspector teams consist of 2-5 individuals.  The author
        of the code to be inspected is not part of the initial inspection
        team!  A code inspection is not a witch hunt -- so no
        witch-hunting!  Our purpose here is to improve the code, not to
        evaluate developers.</p>

      <li><p><strong>Preparing for Inspection</strong></p>

        <p> To get ready for the inspection, print separate hardcopies of
        the source code for each inspector.  A single code
        inspector should cover no more than 250 source code lines,
        including comments, but not including whitespace.
        Surprisingly enough, <em>this is a "carved in stone" limit!</em>
        The hardcopy should contain a count of the source code lines
        shown.</p>

      <li><p><strong>Inspection overview.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The code author spends 20 - 40 minutes explaining the general
        layout of the code to the inspectors.  The inspectors are not
        allowed to ask questions -- the code is supposed to answer them,
        but this overview is designed to speed up the process. The author's
        goal is to stick to the major, important points, and keep it as
        close to 20 minutes as possible without undercutting the
        explanation.</p>

      <li><p><strong>Individual inspections.</strong></p>

        <p>Each inspector uses the attached <a
           href="#checklist">checklist</a> to try to put forward a maximum
           number of discovered possible defects.  This should be done in a
           single, uninterrupted sitting.  The inspector should have a goal
           of covering 70-120 source lines of code per hour.  Use the
           source line counts on the hardcopy, and strive not to inspect
           too quickly, nor too slowly!  [This has been shown in several
           studies to be the next major factor after programming experience
           which affects the number of errors found.  There is a sharp
           drop-off beyond 122 sloc/hr, so don't rush!]</p>

        <p>
          To do the inspection, go through the code line by line,
          attempting to fully understand what you are reading.  At each
          line or block of code, skim through the inspection checklist,
          looking for questions which apply.  For each applicable question,
          find whether the answer is "yes."  A yes answer means a probable
          defect.  Write it down.  You will notice that some of the
          questions are very low-level and concern themselves with
          syntactical details, while others are high-level and require an
          understanding of what a block of code does.  Be prepared to
          change your mental focus.</p>

      <li><p><strong>Meeting.</strong></p>

        <p>The meeting is attended by all the code inspectors for that
          chunk of code.  If you want this to be more like a formal
          inspection, the meeting should have a moderator who is well
          experienced in C or C++, and in conducting code inspections, and
          the author of the code should not be present.  To be more like a
          walkthrough, the moderator may be omitted, or the author may be
          present, or both.  If the author is present, it is for the
          purpose of collecting feedback, not for defending or explaining
          the code.  Remember, one of the major purposes of the inspection
          is to ensure that the code is sufficiently self-explanatory.</p>

        <p>
          Each meeting is strictly limited to two hours duration, including
          interruptions.  This is because inspection ability generally
          drops off after this amount of time.  Strive to stay on task, and
          to not allow interruptions.  Different inspectors may cover
          different groups of code for a single meeting.  Thus, a single
          meeting could theoretically cover a maximum of (5 inspectors) *
          (120 sloc/hr) * (2 hrs) = 1200 lines of source code.  In
          actuality, there should be some overlap between inspectors, up to
          the case of everyone having inspected the same code.</p>

        <p>
          If the group is not finished at the end of two hours, quit.  Do
          not attempt to push ahead. The moderator or note taker should
          submit the existing notes to the author or maintainer, and the
          remaining material should be covered in a subsequent meeting.</p>

      <li><p><strong>Rework</strong></p>

        <p>
          The defects list is submitted to the author, or to another
          asasigned individual for "rework."  This can consist of changing
          code, adding or deleting comments, restructuring or relocating
          things, etc.  Note that solutions are not discussed at the
          inspection meeting! They are neither productive nor necessary in
          that setting.  If the author/maintainer desires feedback on
          solutions or improvements, he or she may hold a short meeting
          with any or all of the inspectors, following the code inspection
          meeting.  The "improvements" meeting is led by the
          author/maintainer, who is free to accept or reject any
          suggestions from the attenders.</p>

      <li><p><strong>Follow up.</strong></p>

        <p>It is the moderator's personal responsibility to ensure all
          defects have been satisfactorily reworked.  If there is no formal
          moderator, then an individual is selected for this role at the
          inspection meeting.  The correctness of the rework will be
          verified either at a short review meeting, or during later
          inspection stages during the project.</p>

      <li><p><strong>Record keeping.</strong></p>

        <p>In order to objectively track success in detecting and
          correcting defects, one of the by-products of the meeting will be
          a count of the total number of different types of potential
          defects noted.  In order to eliminate both the perception and the
          possibility that the records will be used to evaluate developers
          (remember, the goal is to improve the software), then neither the
          name of the author nor the source module will be noted in the
          defect counts.  If absolutely necessary to keep the counts
          straight, a "code module number" may be assigned and used.  The
          document containing the pairing of code modules with their
          numbers will be maintained by a single individual who has no
          management responsibilities on the project, and this document
          will be destroyed upon completion of the code development phase
          of the project.</p>

    <h2><a name="checklist">C++ Inspection Checklist</a></h2>

    <h3>1 VARIABLE  DECLARATIONS</h3>

    <h4>1.1 Arrays</h4>

    <h5>1.1.1 Is an array dimensioned to a hard-coded constant?</h5>

    <p><code>int intarray[13];</code></p>

    <p>should be</p>

    <p><code>int intarray[TOT_MONTHS+1];</code></p>

    <h5>1.1.2 Is the array dimensioned to the total number of items?</h5>

    <p><code>char entry[TOTAL_ENTRIES];</code></p>

    <p>should be</p>

    <p><code>char entry[LAST_ENTRY+1];</code></p>

    <p>The first example is extremely error-prone and often gives rise to
      off-by-one errors in the code.  The preferred (second) method permits
      the writer to use the LAST_ENTRY identi fier to refer to the last
      item in the array.  Instances which require a buffer of a certain
      size are rarely rendered invalid by this practice, which results in
      the buffer being one element bigger than absolutely necessary.</p>

    <h4>1.2 Constants</h4>

    <h5>1.2.1 Does the value of the variable never change?</h5>

    <p><code>int months_in_year = 12;</code></p>

    <p>should be</p>

    <p><code>const  unsigned months_in_year = 12;</code></p>

    <h5>1.2.2 Are constants declared with the preprocessor #define
      mechanism?</h5>

    <p><code>#define MAX_FILES 20</code></p>

    <p>should be</p>

    <p><code>const unsigned MAX_FILES = 20;</code></p>

    <h5>1.2.3 Is the usage of the constant limited to only a few (or
      perhaps only one) class? If so, is the constant global?</h5>

    <p><code>const unsigned MAX_FOOS = 1000;<br>
        const unsigned MAX_FOO_BUFFERS = 40;</code></p>
    
    <p>should be</p>

    <p><pre>
class foo {
  public:
    enum { MAX_INSTANCES = 1000; } 
    ... 
  private: 
    enum { MAX_FOO_BUFFERS = 40; } 
    ... 
};</pre></p>

    <p>If the size of the constant exceeds int, another mechanism is
      available:</p>

<p><pre>
class bar {
  public: 
    static const long MAX_INSTS; 
    ... 
};

const long bar::MAX_INSTS = 70000L;</pre><p>

    <p>The keyword <em>static</em> ensures there is only one instance of the
      variable for the entire class.  Static data items are not permitted
      to be initialized within the class declaration, so the initialization
      line must be included in the implementation file for class bar.</p>

    <p>Static constant members have one drawback: you cannot use them to
      declare member data arrays of a certain size.  This is because the
      value is not available to the compiler at the point which the array
      is declared in the class.</p>

    <h4>1.3 Scalar Variables</h4>

    <h5>1.3.1 Does a negative value of the variable make no sense?  If so,
      is the variable signed?</h5>

    <p><code>int age;</code></p>

    <p>should be</p>

    <p><code>unsigned  int age;</code></p>

    <p>This is an easy error to make, since the default types are usually
      signed.</p>

    <h5>1.3.2 Does the code assume  char  is either  signed  or  unsigned?</h5>

<p><pre>
typedef char SmallInt;

SmallInt mumble = 280; // WRONG on Borland C++ 3.1 
                       // or MSC/C++ 7.0!</pre></p>

    <p>The typedefs should be</p>

<p><pre>
typedef  unsigned  char SmallUInt; 
typedef  signed  char SmallInt;</pre></p>

    <h5>1.3.3 Does the program unnecessarily use  float  or  double ?</h5>

<p><pre>    
double acct_balance;</pre></p>

    <p>should be</p>

<p><pre>
unsigned long acct_balance;</pre></p>

    <p>In general, the only time floating point arithmetic is necessary is
      in scientific or navigational calculations.  It is slow, and subject
      to more complex overflow and underflow behavior than integer math is.
      Monetary calculations, as above, can often be handled in counts of
      cents, and formatted properly on output.  Thus, acct_balance might
      equal 103446, and print out as $1,034.46.</p>

    <h4>1.4 Classes</h4>

    <h5>1.4.1 Does the class have any virtual functions?  If so, is the
      destructor non-virtual?</h5>

    <p>Classes having virtual functions should always have a virtual
      destructor.  This is necessary since it is likely that you will hold
      an object of a class with a pointer of a less derived type.  Making
      the destructor virtual ensures that the right code will be run if you
      delete the object via the pointer.</p>

    <h5>1.4.2 Does the class have any of the following:</h5>

    <ul>
      <li>Copy-constructor 
      <li>Assignment operator 
      <li>Destructor
    </ul>

    <p>If so, it generally will need all three.  (Exceptions may
      occasionally be found for some classes having a destructor with
      neither of the other two.</p>

    <h3>2 DATA  USAGE</h3>

    <h4>2.1 Strings</h4>

    <h5>2.1.1 Can the string ever  not  be null-terminated?</h5>
    
    <h5>2.1.2 Is the code attempting to use a strxxx() function on a
      non-terminated char array, as if it were a string?</h5>

    <h4>2.2 Buffers</h4>

    <h5>2.2.1 Are there always size checks when copying into the buffer?</h5>

    <h5>2.2.2 Can the buffer ever be too small to hold its contents?</h5>

    <p>For example, one program had no size checks when reading data into a
      buffer because the correct data would always fit.  But when the file
      it read was accidentally overwritten with incorrect data, the program
      crashed mysteriously.</p>

    <h4>2.3 Bitfields</h4>

    <h5>2.3.1 Is a bitfield really  required  for this application?</h5>

    <h5>2.3.2 Are there possible ordering problems (portability)?</h5>

    <h3>3 INITIALIZATION</h3>

    <h4>3.1 Local Variables</h4>

    <h5>3.1.1 Are local variables initialized before being used?</h5>

    <h5><a name="3_1_2">3.1.2 Are C++ locals created, then assigned later?
    </a></h5>

    <p>This practice has been shown to incur up to 350% overhead, compared
      to the practice of declaring the variable later in the code, when an
      initialization variable is known.  It is the simple matter of putting
      a value in once, instead of assigning some default value, then later
      throwing it away and assigning the real value.</p>

    <h4>3.2 Missing Reinitialization</h4>

    <h5>3.2.1 Can a variable carry an old value forward from one loop
      iteration to the next?</h5>

    <p>Suppose the processing of a data element in a sequence causes a
      variable to be set.  For example, a file might be read, and some
      globals initialized for that file.  Can those globals be used for the
      next file in the sequence without being re-initialized?</p>

    <h3>4 MACROS</h3>

    <h5>4.1 If a macro's formal parameter is evaluated more than once, is
      the macro ever expanded with a actual parameter having side effects?</h5>

    <p>For example, what happens in this code:</p>

<p><pre>
#define max(a,b) ( (a) > (b) ? (a) : (b) ) 

max(i++, j);</pre></p>

    <h5>4.2 If a macro is not completely parenthesized, is it ever invoked
      in a way that will cause unexpected results?</h5>

<p><pre>
#define max(a, b) (a) > (b) ? (a) : (b) result = max(i, j) + 3;</pre></p>

    <p>This expands into:</p>

<p><pre>
result = (i) > (j) ? (i) : (j)+3;</pre></p>

    <p>See the example in 4.1 for the correct parenthesization.</p>

    <h5>4.3 If the macro's arguments are not parenthesized, will this ever
      cause unexpected results?</h5>

<p><pre>
#define IsXBitSet(var)  (var && bitmask) result = IsXBitSet( i || j );
</pre></p>

    <p>This expands into:</p>

<p><pre>
result = (i || j && bitmask);  // not what expected!</pre></p>

    <p>The correct form is:</p>

<p><pre>
#define IsXBitSet(var) ((var) && (bitmask))</pre></p>

    <h3>5 SIZING OF  DATA</h3>

    <h5>5.1 In a function call with arguments for a buffer and its size, is
      the argument to sizeof different from the buffer argument?</h5>

    <p>For example:</p>

<p><pre>
memset(buffer1, 0, sizeof(buffer2));  // danger!</pre></p>

    <p>This is not always an error, but it is a dangerous practice.  Each
      instance should be verified as (a) necessary, and (b) correct, and
      then commented as such.</p>

    <h5>5.2 Is the argument to  sizeof  an incorrect type?</h5>

    <p>Common errors:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>sizeof(ptr) instead of sizeof(*ptr)
      <li>sizeof(*array) instead of sizeof(array)
      <li>sizeof(array) instead of sizeof(array[0]) (when the user wanted
        the size of an element)
    </ul>

    <h3>6 DYNAMIC  ALLOCATION</h3>

    <h4>6.1 Allocating Data</h4>

    <h5>6.1.1 Is too little space being allocated?</h5>

    <h5>6.1.2 Does the code allocate memory and then assume someone else
      will delete it?</h5>

    <p>This is not always an error, but should always be prominently
      documented, along with the reason for implementing in this manner.
      Constructors which allocate, paired with destructors which
      deallocate, are an obvious exception, since a single object has
      control of its class data.</p>

    <h5>6.1.3 Is malloc(), calloc(), or realloc() used in lieu of new?</h5>

    <p>C standaard library allocation functions should never be used in C++
      programs, since C++ provides an allocation operator.</p>

    <p>If you find you  must  mix C allocation with C++ allocation:</p>

    <h5>6.2.2 Is malloc , calloc , or realloc invoked for an object which
      has a constructor?</h5>

    <p>Program behavior is undefined if this is done.</p>

    <h4>6.2 Deallocating Data</h4>

    <h5>6.2.1 Are arrays being deleted as if they were scalars?</h5>

<p><pre>
delete  myCharArray;</pre></p>
    
    <p>should be</p>

<p><pre>
delete [] myCharArray;</pre>

    <h5>6.2.2 Does the deleted storage still have pointers to it?</h5>

    <p>It is recommended that pointers are set to NULL following deletion,
      or to another safe value meaning "uninitialized."  This is neither
      necessary nor recommended within destructors, since the pointer
      variable itself will cease to exist upon exiting.</p>

    <h5>6.2.3 Are you deleting already-deleted storage?</h5>

    <p>This is not possible if the code conforms to 6.2.2.  The draft C++
      standard specifies that it is always safe to delete a NULL pointer,
      so it is not necessary to check for that value.</p>

If C standard library allocators are used in a C++ program (not recommended):

    <h5>6.2.4 Is delete invoked on a pointer obtained via malloc , calloc ,
      or realloc?</h5>

    <h5>6.2.5 Is free invoked on a pointer obtained via new?</h5>

    <p>Both of these practices are dangerous.  Program behavior is
      undefined if you do them, and such usage is specifically deprecated
      by the ANSI draft C++ standard.</p>

    <h3>7 POINTERS</h3>

    <h5>7.1 When dereferenced, can the pointer ever be NULL?</h5>

    <h5>7.2 When copying the value of a pointer, should it instead allocate
      a copy of what the first pointer points to?</h5>

    <h3>8 CASTING</h3>

    <h5>8.1 Is NULL cast to the correct type when passed as a function
      argument?</h5>

    <h5>8.2 Does the code  rely  on an implicit type conversion?</h5>

    <p>C++ is somewhat charitable when arguments are passed to functions:
      if no function is found which exactly matches the types of the
      arguments supplied, it attempts to apply certain type conversion
      rules to find a match.  While this saves unnecessary casting, if more
      than one function fits the conversion rules, it will result in a
      compilation error. Worse, it can cause additions to the type system
      (either from adding a related class, or from adding an overloaded
      function) to cause previously working code to break!</p>

    <p>See the <a href="#appendixA">Appendix (A)</a> for an example.</p>

    <h3>9 COMPUTATION</h3>

    <h5>9.1 When testing the value of an assignment or computation, is the
      parenthesization incorrect?</h5>

if ( a = function() == 0 )

should be

if ( (a = function()) == 0 )

    <h5>9.2 Can any synchronized values not get updated?</h5>

    <p>Sometimes, a group of variables must be modified as a group to
      complete a single conceptual "transaction."  If this does not occur
      all in one place, is it guaranteed that all variables get updated if
      a single value changes?  Do all updates occur before any of the
      values are tested or used?</p>

    <h3>10 CONDITIONALS</h3>

    <h5>10.1 Are exact equality tests used on floating point numbers?</h5>

<p><pre>
if ( someVar == 0.1 )</pre></p>

    <p>might never be evaluated as true.  The constant 0.1 is not exactly
      representable by any finite binary mantissa and exponent, thus the
      compiler must round it to some other number.  Calculations involving
      someVar may never result in it taking on that value.<p>

      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> use >, >=, <, or <=, depending on which
      direction you wish the variable bound.</p>

    <h5>10.2 Are unsigned values tested greater than or equal to zero?</h5>

<p><pre>
if ( myUnsignedVar >= 0 )</pre></p>

    <p>will always evaluate true.</p>

    <h5>10.3 Are signed variables tested for equality to zero or another
      constant?</h5>

<p><pre>
if ( mySignedVar ) // not always good

if ( mySignedVar >= 0 ) // better!

if ( mySignedVar <= 0 ) // opposite case</pre></p>

    <p>If the variable is updated by any means other than ++ or --, it may
      miss the value of the test constant entirely.  This can cause subtle
      and frightening bugs when code executes under conditions that weren't
      planned for.</p>

    <h5>10.4 If the test is an error check, could the "error condition"
      actually be legitimate in some cases?</h5>

    <h3>11 FLOW  CONTROL</h3>

    <h4>11.1 Control Variables</h4>

    <h5>11.1.1 Is the lower limit an exclusive limit?</h5>

    <h5>11.1.2 Is the upper limit an inclusive limit?</h5>

    <p>By always using inclusive lower limits and exclusive upper limits, a
      whole class of off by-one errors is eliminated.  Furthermore, the
      following assumptions always apply:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the size of the interval equals the difference of the two limits
      <li>the limits are equal if the interval is empty
      <li>the upper limit is never less than the lower limit
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> instead of saying x>=23 and x<=42 , use
      x>=23 and x<43.</p>

    <h4>11.2 Branching</h4>

    <h5>11.2.1 In a switch statement, is any case not terminated with a
      break statement?</h5>

    <p>When several cases are followed by the same block of code, they may
      be "stacked" together and the code terminated with a single break.</p>

    <p>Cases may also be exited via return.</p>

    <p>All other circumstances requiring "drop through" cases should be
      clearly documented in a strategic comment before the switch .  This
      should only be used when it makes the code simpler and clearer.</p>

    <h5>11.2.2 Does the  switch  statement lack a  default  branch?</h5>

    <p>There should always be a default branch to handle unexpected cases,
      even when it appears that the code can never get there.</p>

    <h5>11.2.3 Does a loop set a boolean flag in order to effect an exit?</h5>

    <p>Consider using  break  instead.  It is likely to simplify the code.</p>

    <h5>11.2.4 Does the loop contain a  continue?</h5>

    <p>If the continue occurs in the body of an if conditional, consider

    <h3>12 ASSIGNMENT</h3>

    <h4>12.1 Assignment operator</h4>

    <h5>12.1.1 Does "a += b" mean something different than "a = a + b"?</h5>

    <p>The programmer should never change the semantics of relationships
      between operators. For the example here, the two statements above are
      semantically identical for intrinsic types (even though the code
      generated might be different), so for a user defined class, they
      should be semantically identical, too.  They may, in fact, be
      implemented differently (+= should be more efficient).</p>

    <h5>12.1.2 Is the argument for a copy constructor or assignment
      operator non const ?</h5>

    <h5>12.1.3 Does the assignment operator fail to test for
      self-assignment?</h5>

    <p>The code for operator=() should always start out with:</p>

<p><pre>
if (this == &right_hand_arg ) 
   return *this;</pre></p>

    <h5>12.1.4 Does the assignment operator return anything other than a
      const reference to this?</h5>

    <p>Failure to return a reference to this prevents the user from writing
      (legal C++):</p>

<p><pre>
a = b = c;</pre></p>

    <p>Failure to make the return reference const allows the user to write
      (illegal C++):</p>

<p><pre>
(a = b) = c;</pre></p>

    <h4>12.2 Use of assignment</h4>

    <h5>12.2.1 Can this assignment be replaced with an initialization?</h5>

    <p>(See <a href="#3_1_2">question 3.1.2</a> and commentary.)</p>

    <h5>12.2.2 Is there a mismatch between the units of the expression and
      those of the variable?</h5>

    <p>For example, you might be calculating the number of bytes for an
      array when the number of elements was requested.  If the elements are
      big (say, a long, or a struct!), you'd be using way too much memory.
    </p>

    <h3>13 ARGUMENT  PASSING</h3>

    <h5>13.1 Are non-intrinsic type arguments passed by value?</h5>

<p><pre>
Foo&  do_something( Foo anotherFoo, Bar someThing );</pre></p>

    <p>should be</p>

<p><pre>
Foo&  do_something( const Foo& anotherFoo, const Bar& someThing );</pre></p>

    <p>While it is cheaper to pass ints, longs, and such by value,
      passing objects this way incurs significant expense due to the
      construction of temporary objects.  The problem becomes more severe
      when inheritance is involved.  Simulate pass-by-value by passing
      const references.</p>

    <h3>14 RETURN  VALUES</h3>

    <h5>14.1 Is the return value of a function call being stored in a type
      that is too narrow? (See <a href="#appendixB">Appendix (B)</a>.)</h5>

    <h5>14.2 Does a public member function return a non const reference or
      pointer to member data?</h5>

    <h5>14.3 Does a public member function return a non const reference or
      pointer to data outside the object?</h5>

    <p>This is permissible provided the data was intended to be shared, and
      this fact is documented in the source code.</p>

    <h5>14.4 Does an operator return a reference when it should return an
      object?</h5>

    <h5>14.5 Are objects returned by value instead of const references?
      (See question 13.1 and commentary.)</h5>

    <h3>15 FUNCTION  CALLS</h3>

    <h4>15.1 Varargs functions (printf, and other functions with ellipsis
      ...)</h4>

    <h5>15.1.1 Is the FILE argument of fprintf missing?  (This happens all
      the time.)</h5>

    <h5>15.1.2 Are there extra arguments?</h5>

    <h5>15.1.3 Do the argument types explicitly match the conversion
      specifications in the format string?  (printf and friends.)</h5>

    <p>Type checking cannot occur for functions with variable length
      argument lists.</p>

    <p>For example, a user was surprised to see nonsensical values when the
      following code was executed:</p>

<p><pre>
printf(" %d %ld \n", a_long_int, another_long_int);</pre></p>

    <p>On that particular system, int s and long s were different sizes (2
      and 4 bytes, respectively).  printf() is responsible for manually
      accessing the stack; thus, it saw "%d" and grabbed 2 bytes (an int).
      It then saw "%ld" and grabbed 4 bytes (a long).  The two values
      printed were the MSW of a_long_int , and the combination of
      a_long_int 's LSW and another_long_int 's MSW.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> ensure types explicitly match.  If
      necessary, arguments may be cast to smaller sizes ( long to int ) if
      the author knows for certain that the smaller type can hold all
      possible values of the variable.</p>

    <h4>15.2 General functions</h4>

    <h5>15.2.1 Is this function call correct?  That is, should it be a
      different function with a similar name?  (E.g. strchr instead of
      strrchr?)</h5>

    <h5>15.2.2 Can this function violate the preconditions of a called
      function?</h5>

    <h3>16 FILES</h3>

    <h5>16.1 Can a temporary file name not be unique?</h5>

    <p>(This is, surprisingly enough, a common design bug.)</p>

    <h5>16.2 Is a file pointer reused without closing the previous file?</h5>

<p><pre>
fp = fopen(...);

fp = fopen(...);</pre></p>

    <h5>16.3 Is a file not closed in case of an error return?</h5>

    <h2>Appendix</h2>

    <h3><a name="appendixA">A. Errors due to implicit type
        conversions.</a></h3>

    <p>Code which relies upon implicit type conversions may become broken
      when new classes or functions are added.  For example:</p>

<p><pre>
class String { 
  public: 
    String( char *arg ); // copy constructor operator const char* () const;
  // ... 
};

void foo( const String& aString ); 
void bar( const char *anArray );

// Now, we added the following class

class Word { 
  public: 
    Word( char *arg ); // copy constructor 
  // ... 
};

// need another foo that works with "Words" 

void foo( const Word& aWord );

int gorp() 
{ 
    foo("hello"); // This used to work! 
                  // Now it breaks!  What gives?

    String baz = "quux"; 
    bar(baz); // but this still works. 
}</pre></p>

    <p>The code worked before class Word and the second foo() were added.
      Even though there was no foo() accepting an argument of type const
      char * (i.e. a constant string like "hello"), there is a foo() which
      takes a constant String argument by reference.  And (un)fortunately,
      there is also a way to convert Strings to char * 's and vice-versa.
      So the compiler performed the implicit conversion.</p>

    <p>Now, with the addition of class Word , and another foo() which works
      with it, there is a problem.  The line which calls foo("hello") matches
      both:</p>

<p><pre>
void foo( const String& );

void foo( const Word& );</pre></p>

    <p>Since the mechanisms of the failure may be distributed among two or
      more header files in addition to the implementation file, along with
      a lot of other code, it may be difficult to find the real problem.
      The easiest solution is to recognize while coding or inspecting that
      a function call results in implicit type conversion, and either (a)
      overload the function to provide an explicitly typed variant, or (b)
      explicitly cast the argument.</p>

    <p>Option (a) is preferred over (b), since (b) defeats automatic type
      checking.  Option (a) can still be implemented very efficiently,
      simply by writing the new function as a forwarding function and
      making it inline.</p>

    <h3><a name="appendixB">B. Errors due to loss of "precision" in return
        values</a></h3>

    <p>Functions which can return EOF should not have their return values
      stored in a char variable. For example:</p>

<p><pre>
int getchar(void);

char chr;

while ( (chr = getchar()) != EOF )  { ... };</pre></p>

    <p>should be:</p>

<p><pre>
int tmpchar;

while ( (tmpchar = getchar()) != EOF )  { 
    chr = (char) tmpchar; // or use casted tmpchar ... 
                          // throughout... 
};</pre></p>

    <p>The practice in the top example is unsafe because functions like
      getchar() may return 257 different values: valid characters with
      indexes 0 -255, plus EOF (-1).  If sizeof(int) > sizeof(char) , then
      information will be lost when the high-order byte(s) are scraped off
      prior to the test for EOF.  This can cause the test to fail.  Worse
      yet, depending on whether char is signed or unsigned by default on
      the particular compiler and machine being used, sign extension can
      wreak havoc and cause some of these loops never to terminate.</p>

    <h3><a name="appendixC">C. Loop Checklist</a></h3>

    <p>The following loops are indexed correctly, and are handy for
      comparisons when doing inspections.  If the actual code doesn't look
      like one of these, chances are that something is wrong -- or at least
      that something could be clearer.</p>

    <p>Acceptable forms of  for  loops which avoid off-by-one errors.</p>

<p><pre>
for ( i = 0; i <= max_index; ++i )

for ( i = 0; i < sizeof(array); ++i )

for ( i = max_index; i >= 0; --i )

for ( i = max_index; i ; --i )</pre></p>
