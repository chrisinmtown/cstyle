# cstyle

This is an archive of style guides for C and C++ code that I collected
in the 1990s. Also archived here are some documents that discuss the
value and utility of style guides.

The list includes original versions whenever possible. If you have a
working formatter (either LaTeX or troff), the original versions are
almost certainly the best. If you've never heard of those old software
packages (showing my age here :), start with the HTML version.

All files are copyright by their original authors.
I assert a Creative Commons license only for this compilation.

## Style generator

If you would like a quick way to develop your own style guide
for C, C++, or Java, Sven Rosvall offers a style-document generator.
His page lets you make some choices about various constructs, and the
generator builds a HTML document for you.
