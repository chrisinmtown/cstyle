Abstract
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Much is said about ``standing on other people's shoulders, not their toes'',
but in fact the wheel is re-invented every day in the
Unix/C
community.
Worse, often it is re-invented badly, with bumps, corners, and cracks.
There are ways of avoiding this:
some of them bad, some of them good,
most of them under-appreciated and under-used.

Introduction
</H2>
<P>
``Everyone knows'' that that the
<!--. UX /C-->
Unix/C community and its programmers are the very paragons of re-use
of software.  In some ways this is true.
Brian Kernighan [1] and others have waxed eloquent about how outstanding
Unix
is as an environment for software re-use.
Pipes, the shell, and the design of programs as `filters' do much to
encourage programmers to build on others' work rather than starting from
scratch.
Major applications can be, and often are, written without a line of C.
Of course, there are always people who insist on doing everything themselves,
often citing `efficiency' as the compelling reason why they
can't possibly build on the work of others
(see [2] for some commentary on this).
But surely these are the lamentable exceptions, rather than the rule?
<P>
Well, in a word, no.
<P>
At the level of shell programming, yes, software re-use is widespread in the
<!--. UX /C-->
Unix
community.
Not quite as widespread or as effective as it might be, but definitely common.
When the time comes to write programs in C, however, the situation changes.
It took a radical change in directory format to make people use
a library to read directories.
Many new programs still contain hand-crafted code to analyze their arguments,
even though prefabricated help for this has been available for years.
C programmers tend to think that ``re-using software''
means being able to take
the source for an existing program and edit it to produce the source for
a new one.
While that <I>is</I> a useful technique, there are better ways.
<P>
Why does it matter that re-invention is rampant?
Apart from the obvious, that programmers have more work to do, I mean?
Well, extra work for the programmers is not exactly an unmixed blessing,
even from the programmers' viewpoint!
Time spent re-inventing facilities that are already available is time that
is <I>not</I> available to improve user interfaces, or to make the program
run faster, or to chase down the proverbial Last Bug.
Or, to get really picky, to make the code readable and clear so that our
successors can <I>understand</I> it.
<P>
Even more seriously, re-invented wheels are often square.
Every time that a line of code is re-typed is a new chance for bugs to
be introduced.
There will always be the temptation to take shortcuts based on how
the code will be used-shortcuts that may turn around and bite the
programmer when
the program is modified or used for something unexpected.
An inferior algorithm may be used because it's ``good enough'' and
the better algorithms are too difficult to reproduce on the spur of
the moment... but the definition of ``good enough'' may change later.
And unless the program is well-commented [here we pause for laughter],
the next person who works on it will have to study the code at length
to dispel the suspicion that there is some subtle reason for the
seeming re-invention.
Finally, to quote [2],
<I>if you re-invent the square wheel, you will not benefit when
somebody else rounds off the corners</I>.
<P>
In short, re-inventing the wheel ought to be a rare event,
occurring only for the most compelling reasons.
Using an existing wheel, or improving an existing one, is usually superior
in a variety of ways.
There is nothing dishonorable about stealing code*
<!--. FS -->
to make life easier and better.
<H2>
Theft via the Editor
</H2>
<P>
Unix
historically has flourished in environments in which full
sources for the system are available.
This led to the most obvious and crudest way of stealing code:
copy the source of an existing program and edit it to do something new.
<P>
This approach does have its advantages.
By its nature, it is the most flexible method of stealing code.
It may be the only viable approach when what is desired is some variant
of a complex algorithm that exists only within an existing program;
a good example was V7 <I>dumpdir</I> (which printed a table of contents
of a backup tape), visibly a modified copy of V7 <I>restor</I> (the only
other program that understood the obscure format of backup tapes).
And it certainly is easy.
<P>
On the other hand, this approach also has its problems.
It creates two subtly-different copies of the same code, which have to
be maintained separately.
Worse, they often have to be maintained ``separately but simultaneously'',
because the new program inherits all the mistakes of the original.
Fixing the same bug repeatedly is so mind-deadening that there is great
temptation to fix it in only
the program that is actually giving trouble... which means that when the
other gives trouble, re-doing the cure must be preceded by re-doing the
investigation and diagnosis.
Still worse, such non-simultaneous bug fixes cause the variants of the
code to diverge steadily.
This is also true of improvements and cleanup work.
<P>
A program created in this way may also be inferior, in some ways, to one
created from scratch.
Often there will be vestigial code left over from the program's
evolutionary ancestors.
Apart from consuming resources (and possibly harboring bugs) without a useful
purpose, such vestigial code greatly complicates understanding the new
program in isolation.
<P>
There is also the possibility that the new program has inherited a poor
algorithm from the old one.
This is actually a universal problem with stealing code,
but it is especially troublesome with this technique because the original
program probably was not built with such re-use in mind.
Even if its algorithms were good for <I>its</I> intended purpose,
they may not be versatile enough to do a good job in their new role.
<P>
One relatively clean form of theft via editing is to alter the original
program's source to generate either desired program by conditional
compilation.
This eliminates most of the problems.
Unfortunately, it does so only if the two programs are sufficiently similar
that they can share most of the source.
When they diverge significantly, the result can be a maintenance nightmare,
actually worse than two separate sources.
Given a close similarity, though, this method can work well.
<H2>
Theft via Libraries
</H2>
<P>
The obvious way of using somebody else's code is to call a library function.
Here,
Unix
has had some success stories.
Almost everybody uses the <I>stdio</I> library rather than inventing their own
buffered-I/O package.
(That may sound trivial to those who never programmed on a V6 or earlier
<!--. UX ,-->
Unix
but in fact it's a great improvement on the earlier state of affairs.)
The simpler sorts of string manipulations are usually done with the
<I>strxxx</I> functions rather than by hand-coding them,
although efficiency issues and the wide diversity of requirements have
limited these functions to less complete success.
Nobody who knows about <I>qsort</I> bothers to write his own sorting
function.
<P>
However, these success stories are pleasant islands in an ocean of mud.
The fact is that
<!--. UX 's-->
Unix
libraries are a disgrace.
They are well enough implemented, and their design flaws are seldom more
than nuisances, but there aren't <I>enough</I> of them!
Ironically,
<!--. UX 's-->
Unix
``poor cousin'',
the Software Tools community [3,4],
has done much better at this.
Faced with a wild diversity of different operating systems,
they were forced to put much more emphasis on identifying clean abstractions
for system services.
<P>
For example,
the Software Tools version of <I>ls</I> runs unchanged, <I>without</I>
conditional compilation, on dozens of different operating systems [4].
By contrast,
Unix
programs that read directories invariably dealt with the raw system
data structures, until Berkeley turned this cozy little world upside-down
with a change to those data structures.
The Berkeley implementors were wise enough to provide a library for
directory access, rather than just documenting the new underlying structure.
However,
true to the
Unix
pattern,
they designed a library which quietly assumed (in some of its naming
conventions) that the underlying system used <I>their</I> structures!
This particular nettle has finally been grasped firmly by the IEEE POSIX
project [5], at the cost of yet another slightly-incompatible interface.
<P>
The adoption of the new directory libraries is not just
a matter of convenience and portability:
in general the libraries are faster than the hand-cooked code
they replace.
Nevertheless, Berkeley's original announcement of the change was greeted
with a storm of outraged protest.
<P>
Directories, alas, are not an isolated example.
The
<!--. UX /C-->
Unix
community simply hasn't made
much of an effort to identify common code
and package it for re-use.
One of the two major variants of
Unix
still lacks a library function for binary search,
an algorithm which is notorious for both the performance boost it can
produce
and the difficulty of coding a fully-correct version from scratch.
No major variant of
Unix
has a library function for either one of the following code fragments,
both omnipresent (or at least, they <I>should</I> be omnipresent [6]) in
simple* programs that use the relevant facilities:
<!--. FS -->
<!--. DS -->
<PRE>
if ((f = fopen(filename, mode)) == NULL)
	<I>print error message with filename, mode, and specific
	reason for failure, and then exit</I>
<!--. DE -->
</PRE>
<!--. DS -->
<PRE>
if ((p = malloc(amount)) == NULL)
	<I>print error message and exit</I>
<!--. DE -->
</PRE>
These may sound utterly trivial, but in fact programmers almost never
produce as good an error message for <I>fopen</I> as ten lines
of library code can, and half the time the return value from <I>malloc</I>
isn't checked at all!
<P>
These examples
illustrate a general principle, a side benefit of stealing code:
the way to encourage standardization and
<!--. FS -->
quality is to make it easier to be
careful and standard than to be sloppy and non-standard.
On systems with library functions for error-checked
<I>fopen</I> and <I>malloc</I>, it is easier to use the system
functions-which take some care to do ``the right thing''-than to
kludge it yourself.
This makes converts very quickly.
<P>
These are not isolated examples.
Studying the libraries of most any
<!--. UX "" non--->
Unix
system will yield other ideas for useful library functions
(as well as a lot of silly nonsense that
Unix
doesn't need, usually!).
A few years of
Unix
systems programming also leads to recognition of repeated needs.
Does <I>your</I>*
Unix
have library functions
<!--. FS -->
to:
<UL>
<LI>
decide whether a filename is well-formed (contains no control characters,
shell metacharacters, or white space, and is within
any name-length limits your system sets) ?
<LI>
close all file descriptors except the standard ones?
<LI>
compute a standard CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check ``checksum'')?
<LI>
operate on <I>malloc</I>ed unlimited-length strings?
<LI>
do what <I>access</I>(2) does but using the effective userid?
<LI>
expand metacharacters in a filename the same way the shell does?
(the simplest way to make sure that the two agree is to use <I>popen</I>
and <I>echo</I> for anything complicated)
<LI>
convert integer baud rates to and from the speed codes used by
your system's serial-line <I>ioctl</I>s?
<LI>
convert integer file modes to and from the <I>rwx</I> strings
used to present such modes to humans?
<!--. FS -->
<LI>
do a binary search through a file the way <I>look</I>(1) does?
<!--. RE -->
</UL>
<P>
The above are fairly trivial examples of the sort of things that <I>ought</I>
to be in
Unix
libraries.
More sophisticated libraries can also be useful,
especially if the language provides better support for them
than C does; C++ is an example [7].
Even in C, though, there is much room for improvement.
<P>
Adding library functions does have its disadvantages.
The interface to a library function is important,
and getting it right is hard.
Worse, once users have started using one version of an interface,
changing it is very difficult even when hindsight clearly shows mistakes;
the near-useless return values of some of the common
Unix
library functions are obvious examples.
Satisfactory handling of error conditions can be difficult.
(For example, the error-checking <I>malloc</I> mentioned earlier is very
handy for programmers, but invoking it from a library function would be
a serious mistake, removing any possibility of more intelligent response
to that error.)
And there is the perennial headache of trying to get others to adopt your
pet function, so that programs using it can be portable without having to
drag the source of the function around too.
For all this, though, libraries are in many ways the most satisfactory
way of encouraging code theft.
<P>
Alas, encouraging code theft does not guarantee it.
Even widely-available library functions often are not used nearly
as much as they should be.
A conspicuous example is <I>getopt</I>, for command-line argument parsing.
<I>Getopt</I>
supplies only quite modest help in parsing the command line,
but the standardization and consistency that its use produces is still
quite valuable; there are far too many pointless variations in command
syntax in the hand-cooked argument parsers in most
Unix
programs.
Public-domain implementations of <I>getopt</I> have been available for years,
and AT&amp;T has published (!) the source for the System V implementation.
Yet people continue to write their own argument parsers.
There is one valid reason for this, to be discussed in the next section.
There are also a number of excuses, mostly the standard ones for not
using library functions:

<UL>
<LI>
``It doesn't do quite what I want.''
<I>But often it is close enough to serve, and the combined
benefits of code theft and standardization outweigh the minor mismatches.</I>
<LI>
``Calling a library function is too inefficient.''
<I>This is mostly heard from people who have never profiled their programs
and hence have no </I>reliable<I> information about what their code's
efficiency problems are [2].</I>
<LI>
``I didn't know about it.''
<I>Competent programmers know the contents of their toolboxes.</I>
<LI>
``That whole concept is ugly, and should be redesigned.''
(Often said of <I>getopt</I>, since the usual
Unix
single-letter-option syntax
that <I>getopt</I> implements
is widely criticized as user-hostile.)
<I>How likely is it that the rest of the world will go along with your
redesign (assuming you ever finish it)?
Consistency and a high-quality implementation are valuable even if the
standard being implemented is suboptimal.</I>
<LI>
``I would have done it differently.''
<I>The triumph of personal taste over professional programming.</I>
<!--. RE -->
</UL>
<H2>
Theft via Templates
</H2>
<P>
<I>Templates</I> are a major and much-neglected approach to code sharing:
``boilerplate'' programs which contain a carefully-written skeleton
for some moderately stereotyped task,
which can then be adapted and filled in as needed.
This method has some of the vices of modifying existing programs,
but the template can be designed for the purpose,
with attention to quality and versatility.
<P>
Templates can be particularly useful when library functions are used in
a stereotyped way that is a little complicated to write from scratch;
<I>getopt</I> is an excellent example.
The one really valid objection to <I>getopt</I> is that
its invocation is not trivial,
and typing in the correct sequence from scratch is a real test of memory.
The usual <I>getopt</I> manual page contains a lengthy example
which is essentially a template for
a <I>getopt</I>-using program.
<P>
When the first public-domain <I>getopt</I> appeared,
it quickly became clear that it would be convenient to have a template
for its use handy.
This template eventually grew to incorporate a number of other things:
a useful macro or two,
definition of <I>main</I>,
opening of files in the standard
Unix
filter fashion,
checking for mistakes like opening a directory,
filename and line-number tracking for error messages,
and some odds and ends.
The full current version can be found in the Appendix;
actually it diverged into two distinct versions when it became clear that
some filters wanted the illusion of a single input stream,
while others wanted to handle each input file individually (or didn't care).
<P>
The obvious objection to this line of development is ``it's more complicated
than I need''.
In fact, it turns out to be surprisingly convenient to have all this
machinery presupplied.
<I>It is much easier to alter or delete lines of code than to add them.</I>
If directories are legitimate input, just delete the code that catches them.
If no filenames are allowed as input, or exactly one must be present,
change one line of code to enforce the restriction and a few more to
deal with the arguments correctly.
If the arguments are not filenames at all, just delete the bits of code
that assume they are.
And so forth.
<P>
The job of
writing an ordinary filter-like program is reduced to filling in two or
three blanks* in the template, and then writing the code that actually
<!--. FS -->
processes the data.
Even quick improvisations become good-quality programs,
doing things the standard way with all the proper amenities,
because even a quick improvisation is easier
to do by starting from the template.
<I>Templates are an unmixed blessing;
anyone who types a non-trivial program in from scratch is
wasting his time and his employer's money.</I>
<P>
Templates are also useful for other stereotyped files, even ones that
are not usually thought of as programs.
Most versions of
Unix
have a simple template for manual pages hiding somewhere
(in V7 it was <I>/usr/man/man0/xx</I>).
Shell files that want to analyze complex argument lists have the same
<I>getopt</I> problem as C programs, with the same solution.
There is enough machinery in a ``production-grade'' <I>make</I> file to
make a template worthwhile, although this one tends to get altered
fairly heavily; our current one is in the Appendix.
<H2>
Theft via Inclusion
</H2>
<P>
Source inclusion (<B>#include</B>) provides a way of sharing both
data structures and executable code.
Header files (e.g. <I>stdio.h</I>) in particular tend to be taken for granted.
Again, those who haven't been around long enough to remember V6
Unix
may
have trouble grasping what a revolution it was when V7 introduced systematic
use of header files!
<P>
However, even mundane header files could be rather more useful than they
normally are now.
Data structures in header files are widely accepted, but there is somewhat
less use of them to declare the return types of functions.
One or two common header files like <I>stdio.h</I> and <I>math.h</I> do this,
but programmers are still used to the idea that the type of (e.g.)
<I>atol</I> has to be typed in by hand.
Actually, all too often the programmer says ``oh well, on my machine it
works out all right if I don't bother declaring <I>atol</I>'',
and the result is dirty and unportable code.
The X3J11 draft ANSI standard for C addresses this by defining some more
header files and requiring their use for portable programs,
so that the header files can do all the work and do it <I>right</I>.
<P>
In principle, source inclusion can be used for more than just header files.
In practice, almost anything that can be done with source inclusion can be
done, and usually done more cleanly, with header files and libraries.
There are occasional specialized exceptions, such as using macro definitions
and source inclusion to fake parameterized data types.
<H2>
Theft via Invocation
</H2>
<P>
Finally, it is often possible to steal another program's code simply by
invoking that program.
Invoking other programs via
<I>system</I> or
<I>popen</I> for things that are easily done in
C is a common beginner's error.
More experienced programmers can go too far the other way, however, insisting
on doing everything in C, even when a leavening of other methods would
give better results.
The best way to sort a large file is probably to invoke <I>sort</I>(1),
not to do it yourself.
Even invoking a shell file can be useful,
although a bit odd-seeming
to most C programmers,
when elaborate file manipulation is needed and efficiency is not critical.
<P>
Aside from invoking other programs at run time,
it can also be useful to invoke them at compile time.
Particularly when dealing with large tables,
it is often better to dynamically generate the C code from some
more compact and readable notation.
<I>Yacc</I> and <I>lex</I> are familiar examples of this on a large scale,
but simple <I>sed</I> and <I>awk</I> programs can build tables in more
specialized, application-specific ways.
Whether this is really theft is debatable, but it's a valuable technique
all the same.
It can neatly bypass a lot of objections that start with
``but C won't let me write...''.
<H2>
An Excess of Invention
</H2>
<P>
With all these varied methods, why is code theft not more widespread?
Why are so many programs unnecessarily invented from scratch?
<P>
The most obvious answer is the hardest to counter:
theft requires that there be something to steal.
Use of library functions is impossible unless somebody sets up a library.
Designing the interfaces for library functions is not easy.
Worse, doing it <I>well</I> requires insight, which generally isn't
available on demand.
The same is true, to varying degrees, for the other forms of theft.
<P>
Despite its reputation as a hotbed of software re-use,
Unix is actually hostile to some of these activities.
If Unix directories had been complex and obscure,
directory-reading libraries would have been present from the beginning.
As it is, it was simply <I>too easy</I> to do things ``the hard way''.
There <I>still</I> is no portable set of functions to perform the
dozen or so useful manipulations of terminal modes that a user program
might want to do, a major nuisance
because changing those modes ``in the raw'' is simple but highly unportable.
<P>
Finally,
there is the Not Invented Here syndrome, and its relatives,
Not Good Enough and Not Understood Here.
How else to explain AT&amp;T
Unix's persistent lack of the <I>dbm</I> library for hashed databases
(even though it was developed at Bell Labs and hence is available to
AT&amp;T), 
and Berkeley
Unix's
persistent lack of the full set of <I>strxxx</I> functions
(even though a public-domain implementation has existed for years)?
The X3J11 and
POSIX efforts are making some progress at developing a common nucleus of
functionality, but they are aiming at a common subset of current
systems, when what is really wanted is a common superset.
<H2>
Conclusion
</H2>
<P>
In short, never build what you can (legally) steal!
Done right, it yields better programs for less work.
